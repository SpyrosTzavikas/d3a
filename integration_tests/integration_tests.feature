Feature: Run integration tests

  Scenario Outline: Run integration tests on console
     Given we have a scenario named <scenario>
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation on console with <scenario>
     Then we test the export functionality of <scenario>
  Examples: Scenarios
     | scenario |
     | integration_test_setup |

  Scenario Outline: Run integration tests
     Given we have a scenario named <scenario>
     And d3a is installed
     When we run the d3a simulation with <scenario> [<duration>, <slot_length>, <tick_length>]
     Then we test the output of the simulation of <scenario> [<duration>, <slot_length>, <tick_length>]
  Examples: Settings
     | scenario   | duration | slot_length | tick_length |
     | integration_test_setup |    2     |      20     |      1      |
     | integration_test_setup |    4     |      10     |      5      |
